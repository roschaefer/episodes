## [0.3.0](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) (2026-10-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* a .splice with default-branch in [splice] is refused; move it to upstream.<name>.default-branch.
* **splice-file:** a `.splice` with `splice.url`, or without an id, is refused without printing how to convert it.
* a `.splice` without an id is refused.
* **rebuild:** the first push after `init` sends one commit, the init commit, instead of the folder's whole history.
* a nested `.splice` without `default-branch` that this monorepo wrote itself, where the nested upstream's default branch equals the monorepo's but not the outer upstream's, now follows the outer upstream's default branch. Set `default-branch` in it by hand to keep the old meaning.

### Features

* print a splice's rebuild, the commit push would send ([#103](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/103)) ([1dcb575](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/1dcb575ef9362d0db3f216fccf24e5e5c4e24fb8)), closes [#54](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/54)

* **merge:** record an upstream with the same files as the synced commit ([#92](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/92)) ([c0e8334](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/c0e8334303d091fdac91ef8fa71089055648b1d9)), closes [#17](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/17)
* **rebuild:** find a splice's boundary and mount with log.showSignature ([#111](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/111)) ([eb8849b](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/eb8849b89ca18a6093bdb12bf3c228bb4d40658f))

* **rebuild:** take a nested splice's history before the outer boundary from the outer upstream ([#83](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/83)) ([89b294b](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/89b294b6e49688f7e662a86526f874b7927d1c17)), closes [#74](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/74)


### Performance Improvements

* **rebuild:** read a splice's id once in the mount walk ([#98](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/98)) ([83f1f25](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/83f1f253f2bb595bed980aa357f1496dd521395e))

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* fetched refs move from refs/splices/<escaped URL>/-/ to refs/splices/<key>/. Refs in the old layout are left behind; the next fetch fills the new one.
* .splice's splice.url is replaced by upstream.<name>.url. Every command refuses an old .splice and prints the git config commands that convert it. Refs fetched under the old layout aren't used; the next fetch fetches under the new keys, and the old refs/splices/<path>/ refs can be deleted.
* **status:** status prints counts in place of the diff stat, so scripts that parse its output need updating.
* replace git subtree with .splice state, URL fetches and an own rebuild ([#1](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/1))

### Features

* key fetched refs by short names mapped to upstream URLs ([#58](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/58)) ([1940555](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/1940555d96d6454843a5a9af0abe8f154077cc83))

* **status:** count commits like git status, and move the file summary to diff --stat ([#46](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/46)) ([caef453](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/caef45327d1419705fa1591ed423f6af92cd8a85)), closes [#39](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/39)
* **status:** warn about uncommitted changes in a splice's folder ([#45](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/45)) ([4dc295c](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/commit/4dc295c3bf00caa6cd71d234ad5666186c026a54)), closes [#40](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/40)
