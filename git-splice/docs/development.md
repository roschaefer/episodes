# Development

With [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) and
[flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes), run in the clone:

    nix develop      # shell with the dev tools and this checkout on PATH
    just --list      # lint, fmt, test, ci, bench, walkthrough, ...
    just walkthrough # try commands by hand in a throwaway monorepo
    just site-serve  # this documentation site, reloading on changes

[The design](design/README.md#testing) explains how the tests are
layered and how to write one, and [writing the docs](writing.md) which
markup the documentation uses for what.

Releases come from [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):
it keeps a release PR open with the next version and changelog, built from
the Conventional Commits on `main`. Merging it tags and publishes the
release.
