# Going forward

Ideas `git-splice` doesn't implement. Some are planned, some are out of
scope, and some are impossible with Git. Each page says which is which.

- [Package managers](package-managers.md): what maps from npm, Yarn or
  Cargo to nested splices, and what doesn't. Out of scope: `git-splice`
  isn't meant to become a package manager.
- [Mirrors](mirrors.md): splices with the same id are meant to have the
  same files. A report of mirrors that drifted is possible; sharing one
  folder isn't, with Git.
- [Jujutsu](jj.md): what `git-splice` needs to work in a jj repository,
  e.g. what stands for the current and the default branch there.
- [Sapling](sapling.md): the branch after `sl goto`, and what
  `git-splice` could do with the sync points `sl subtree` records.
- [Weak parents](weak-parents.md): the sync point as a parent of the
  commit that wrote it, which Git can't record without making it part of
  the history. A thought experiment, with earlier proposals.
