# Weak parents

A thought experiment, not a plan: what the sync point U(H) would be if Git
could record it, and who has proposed something like it before. Nothing
here changes how `git-splice` works.

## The sync point is a parent, written into the tree

A pull, the commit that wrote U(H) into `lib/.splice`
([sync model](../../test/concepts/sync-model/README.md)), could have
been a merge instead, with two parents: the monorepo's previous commit,
and U(H). Its tree would be the same as the pull's: U(H)'s files in `lib/`, merged
with the folder's changes since the last sync, if there are any. That's
the commit `git subtree add` and `git subtree pull` create without
`--squash` ([`git subtree` compared](../../test/comparisons/git-subtree.md)).
With `--squash`, the second parent is a new commit with U(H)'s files, and
U(H) isn't in the history at all.

Both record one fact: the folder continues U(H). A second parent records it
in the commit graph, `.splice` as content of the tree. The fact is the
same, but different tools see it:

| | U(H) as a second parent | `commit = U(H)` in `.splice` |
|---|---|---|
| Who sees it | Git: `log`, `merge-base`, `bisect` and `blame` walk into the library's history | Only `git-splice`. To Git, it's a line in a file, and the monorepo's history stays linear |
| U(H)'s objects | Required: every full clone of the monorepo fetches U(H) and all its ancestors, and `gc` keeps them | Optional: `git-splice` fetches U(H) when it needs it |
| Which folder | Git doesn't know: U(H) has the library at its root. `git subtree` needs `--prefix`, and with several splices, which parent belongs to which folder | Where the file is. `git mv` moves it along |
| Finding the current U(H) | Search the history for the newest such merge | Read one file at `HEAD` |
| Rebase, squash merge | Lost: `rebase` drops merges, unless it runs with `--rebase-merges`, and a squash merge keeps one parent | Kept: `.splice` is a file, carried along like the folder's other files |
| The merge base for a pull | `git merge-base HEAD T` finds U(H), even after a push, whose commits aren't in the monorepo's history | `git-splice` rebuilds R on top of U(H), and takes `git merge-base R T`: U(H), or a commit pushed since |

The rebase and squash merge row is the reason for the file. A rewrite
carries a commit's changes to files along, `.splice` included, and a
squash merge keeps nothing else.

The two also don't claim the same. A merge says U(H)'s whole history is
part of the monorepo's. `.splice` says only that the folder's files came
from U(H): changes cross the splice, commits don't.

## A weak parent in Git

Between the two, there could be a third: a *weak parent*. It's
recorded in the commit, like a parent, but it's not part of the commit's
history, like the line in `.splice`:

- `log`, `merge-base` and `rebase` don't follow it.
- A fetch doesn't send its target, and a missing target isn't an error.
- `gc` keeps its target, if it's there.

Git has none, and the idea has come up before.

### The `origin` RFC, 2008

In September 2008, Stephen R. van den Berg proposed an `origin` header
for commits made by `cherry-pick` and `revert`
([thread](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20080909194354.GA13634@cuci.nl/T/)).
His motivation was backports among seven branches: when you change code
that was cherry-picked, you want to find the other copies. The rules he
proposed are those of a weak parent:

> In an existing repository gc/prune shall not delete commits being
> referred to by origin links.
>
> During fetch/push/pull the full commit including the origin fields is
> transmitted, however, the objects the origin links are referring to
> are not
>
> git fsck will traverse origin links, but will stay silent if the
> object an origin link points to is unreachable
>
> git merge disregards the whole origin field entirely

Jakub Narębski summed it up as a link that protects against pruning,
"but it is not considered an error for it to be broken". Following
Paolo Bonzini, the header became a pair, `origin <sha1> <sha2>`: a
change is the difference between two commits, not one commit.

It wasn't merged. The objections, and how they apply to a splice:

- **Linus Torvalds** objected that cherry-picks, squashes and
  `rebase -i` are how people clean up history, so their origins
  shouldn't be recorded. And data a fetch doesn't send is local, so "they
  should not be in the object database at all". The link would be
  "unreliable, random, and depends on the phase of the moon". For a splice, the
  target is the other way round: not local, but a commit of another
  repository, and the link has to survive the clean-up.
- **Petr Baudis** objected that "cherrypicks can be from completely
  unrelated histories". For a splice, that's the normal case: U(H) is in
  the library's history, not the monorepo's.
- **Theodore Ts'o** pointed to `git cherry-pick -x`, which records the
  source in the message, as `(cherry picked from commit …)`. That's
  still Git's answer: a weak link as text, for people and scripts to
  parse.

Since then, Git has gained
[partial clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/partial-clone): a repository
may lack objects it refers to, and fetch them from a *promisor remote*
when needed. A weak parent wouldn't be the only reference to a missing
object any more.

### Submodules

A submodule's gitlink is a weak link that Git has: a commit id in the
tree that the repository doesn't need to have. Like `.splice`, it's in
the tree, not in the commit, so it survives a rebase. Unlike `.splice`,
it says what to check out, not where the folder's files came from
([the sync point](../design/README.md#the-sync-point)).

### Extra commit headers: Sapling and jj

The RFC's `origin` was a new line among a commit's headers, next to
`tree`, `parent` and `author`. Git keeps headers it doesn't know: they are
part of the commit's hash, and `git cat-file -p` shows them. Nothing in
Git writes them, and nothing follows them. Two tools that work in Git
repositories use them today:

- **Sapling** records each `sl subtree` import and merge in a header,
  `test_subtree`, with the library's URL, its commit and the folder
  ([Sapling compared](../../test/comparisons/vcs/sapling.md#import-the-library)).
  That's all three facts a splice needs ([below](#what-a-splice-would-need)).
- **jj** writes a `change-id` header in every commit, the identity a
  change keeps across rewrites. A `jj graft` prototype, discussed on jj's
  Discord, records a folder's sync point in a header too
  ([Jujutsu compared](../../test/comparisons/vcs/jj.md#what-jj-plans)).

A header is half a weak parent: it's in the commit, and `log`,
`merge-base` and `fetch` don't follow it, since Git doesn't know it points
anywhere. The other half needs Git, and Git doesn't know about it either:
`gc` doesn't keep its target, and most rewrites drop it. As of Git 2.56:

| Command | The header |
| --- | --- |
| `commit --amend` | kept |
| `cherry-pick` | dropped |
| `rebase`, with or without `-i` or `--apply` | dropped |
| `merge --squash` | dropped |
| `merge` | stays on the merged commit; the merge commit doesn't get one |

That works for Sapling and jj, since each rewrites commits with its own
commands, which copy the header along: `sl fold` keeps Sapling's record,
and jj keeps the change id. Rewrites with Git, or a squash merge on a
forge, lose it. Then Sapling's next merge starts from an older record,
and a file the library removed
[comes back](../../test/comparisons/vcs/sapling.md#a-squash-merge-drops-the-record).
`git-splice` works with plain Git and squash-merged pull requests, where
only the files survive every rewrite. So the sync point is in a file.

## What a splice would need

The `origin` RFC records only a commit id, and a missing target leaves
the link broken, by design. A splice's target is always in another
repository, so a weak parent for it needs more than a commit id:

- **the target**, U(H),
- **the folder** it maps to, which `git subtree` passes as `--prefix`,
- **where to fetch it from**, which object ids alone don't say.

A gitlink has all three: its place in the tree, and the URL in
`.gitmodules`. What it lacks is the meaning of a parent, that the
folder's files came from U(H) and may have changed since.

And it has to survive the squash merges that Linus listed, which keep
only the changes to files. That's what `.splice` holds: the URL, and U(H),
in the folder they belong to.
