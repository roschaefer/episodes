usage: git splice merge [--upstream <name>] [--bump] [--no-fork-point] (<path>... | --all)

Splices already-fetched upstream changes into each splice, as one ordinary
commit per splice. Never touches the network: run 'git splice fetch'
first, or 'git splice pull' to do both.

The upstream branch is the one named like the current branch; on the
monorepo's default branch, the upstream's default-branch if it has one.

--upstream names one of the upstreams a splice's .splice names; without
it, the splice's default upstream. A splice without the named upstream
stops the command before it starts.

Top-down: a splice is merged before the ones below it, since its merge
can move their synced commits, and a failure stops them.

On a conflict, resolve it and run 'git commit' (or 'git cherry-pick
--abort' to give up), then re-run merge for any splices left. When the two
sides share no history at all, merge doesn't guess: it prints the commands
to keep either side.

When the upstream rewrote its branch, e.g. a fork rebased its patch
branch onto a new release, merge starts at the branch's fork point, like
'git pull --rebase': the newest commit the fetched branch pointed at, by
its reflog, that the folder's history has. Merge then takes the
rewritten branch as it is. If the folder has changes that branch lacks,
it refuses: the next push would publish the rewritten-away commits
again, under them. Set the changes aside, merge, and redo them on top.
--no-fork-point merges from Git's merge base instead.

--bump also moves the synced commit up to the upstream branch when there's
nothing to merge, e.g. right after a push, in a commit that only changes
the splice's .splice, like a submodule bump. Later rebuilds then start
there, instead of rebuilding every pushed commit again.
