usage: git splice merge [--upstream <name>] [--branch <name>] [--bump | --rebase] [--no-fork-point] (<path>... | --all)
   or: git splice merge [<option>...] -m <message> <path>

Splices already-fetched upstream changes into each splice, as one ordinary
commit per splice. Never touches the network: run 'git splice fetch'
first, or 'git splice pull' to do both.

The upstream branch is the one named like the current branch; on the
monorepo's default branch, the upstream's default-branch if it has one,
or the tag or commit its default-pin names.
--branch names another one for this merge, e.g. the one the default
branch follows, on a pull request's branch the upstream has none for.
It doesn't change .splice, and the splices below keep theirs.

--upstream names one of the upstreams a splice's .splice names; without
it, the splice's default upstream. A splice without the named upstream
stops the command before it starts.

Top-down: a splice is merged before the ones below it, since its merge
can move their synced commits, and a failure stops them.

On a conflict, resolve it and run 'git commit' (or 'git cherry-pick
--abort' to give up), then re-run merge for any splices left. When the two
sides share no history at all, merge doesn't guess: it prints the commands
to keep either side.

When the upstream rewrote its branch, e.g. a fork rebased its patch
branch onto a new release, merge starts at the branch's fork point, like
'git pull --rebase': the newest commit the fetched branch pointed at, by
its reflog, that the folder's history has. Merge then takes the
rewritten branch as it is. If the folder has changes that branch lacks,
it refuses: the next push would publish the rewritten-away commits
again, under them. --rebase redoes them on top instead.
--no-fork-point merges from Git's merge base instead.

--bump also moves the synced commit up to the upstream branch when there's
nothing to merge, e.g. right after a push, in a commit that only changes
the splice's .splice, like a submodule bump. Later rebuilds then start
there, instead of rebuilding every pushed commit again.

--rebase rebases instead, like 'git pull --rebase': it takes the
upstream branch in on top of the newest commit whose folder has exactly
the synced commit's files, and rebases the monorepo branch's commits
since then onto that, with 'git rebase'. The next push then sends the
folder's changes as commits on top of the upstream branch, also after
the upstream rewrote it. It rewrites the branch, so it refuses when a
remote-tracking branch has any of those commits, and when one of them is
a merge, whose own changes a rebase would drop. It also refuses when the
upstream branch lacks the synced commit, and its reflog here doesn't
show it ever had it: the folder would lose that commit's changes. The
branch may never have had it, e.g. after 'git rebase main' on a feature
branch, or had it before a rewrite this clone didn't see, e.g. in a
fresh clone. rebase.autoStash and
rebase.updateRefs don't apply: it neither stashes nor moves other
branches. On a conflict, resolve it and run 'git rebase --continue' (or
'git rebase --abort' to give up).

-m gives the commit this message instead of the default one, which
names the upstream branch and commit; with --rebase, the commit the
rebased ones go on top of. It takes one splice: each gets a commit of
its own. Nothing reads the message back: .splice records the synced
commit. On a conflict, 'git commit' keeps the message.
