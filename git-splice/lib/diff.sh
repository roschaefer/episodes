usage: git splice diff [--upstream <name>] [--stat] [path...]

Shows the file changes 'git splice push' would send to each splice's
upstream, with paths as the upstream sees them. Purely local -- run
'git splice fetch' first for up-to-date results. Defaults to every splice
when no paths are given.

--stat summarizes the changes per file instead, like 'git diff --stat'.

For a splice whose upstream has no branch named like the current one, the
diff is against upstream's default branch, from where the two meet, as a
PR from the new branch would show it. Without a default branch upstream,
the whole splice is new.

--upstream names one of the upstreams a splice's .splice names; without
it, the splice's default upstream. A splice without the named upstream
stops the command before it starts.
