usage: git splice key [--upstream <name>] <path> [<new-key>]

Prints the key splice <path>'s upstream has in this repository: its
fetched branches are refs/splices/<key>/heads/<branch>, e.g. for
'git log splices/<key>/heads/main'. With <new-key>, renames the key and
moves its refs along.

--upstream names the upstream, as <path>/.splice does in
[upstream "<name>"]. Without it, the splice's default upstream.

A key belongs to an upstream URL, so splices with the same URL share it.
The first fetch of an upstream records its key in the repository's config,
as splice.<key>.url, from the end of its URL: lib for
https://github.com/x/lib.git, or x-lib, then github.com-x-lib, if that's
taken. A key is lower-case letters, digits, ".", "_" and "-", at most 64
long.
