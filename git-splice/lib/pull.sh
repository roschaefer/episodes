NAME
    git-splice-pull - Fetch and splice in upstream changes

SYNOPSIS
    git splice pull [--upstream <name>] [--branch <name> [--track]] [--bump | --rebase] [--no-fork-point] (<path>... | --all)
    git splice pull [<option>...] -m <message> <path>

DESCRIPTION
    'git splice fetch' followed by 'git splice merge': fetches the splices'
    upstreams in parallel, then splices their changes in, as one ordinary
    commit per splice. Also fetches the splices below each: pulling a splice
    can move their synced commits. Top-down: a splice is pulled before the
    ones below it, and a failed fetch stops the splices above and below it.

    On a conflict, resolve it and run 'git commit' (or 'git cherry-pick
    --abort' to give up), then re-run pull for any splices left. With
    --rebase, it's 'git rebase --continue' (or 'git rebase --abort').

    --upstream names one of the upstreams a splice's .splice names; without
    it, the splice's default upstream. A splice without the named upstream
    stops the command before it starts. The splices below, selected or not,
    are fetched from every upstream they name: names are only unique within one .splice, and
    any of them may have the synced commit the pull moves to.

    --branch names the upstream branch to pull, for this pull only, and
    --track tracks it on the current branch; --rebase rebases
    instead of merging, like 'git pull --rebase'; see 'git splice merge
    --help' for these.

    --bump also moves the synced commit up to the upstream branch when there's
    nothing to pull, e.g. right after a push; see 'git splice merge --help'.

    --no-fork-point merges a rewritten upstream branch from Git's merge base,
    not from where the branch was before the rewrite; see 'git splice merge
    --help'.

    -m gives the commit this message, for one splice; see 'git splice merge
    --help'.
