NAME
    git-splice-rebuild - Print the commit push would send

SYNOPSIS
    git splice rebuild <path>

DESCRIPTION
    Prints the commit 'git splice push <path>' would send: the splice's
    history rebuilt without its .splice file, on top of the upstream commit
    it last synced with. If nothing changed since, that's the synced commit
    itself. The rebuild is deterministic, so a later push sees what was
    pushed of it as already upstream.

    Writes no ref and no monorepo commit. Purely local, but the synced
    commit must have been fetched.

    Push it to an upstream branch other than the one named like the current
    one, e.g. a release branch:

      git push <url> "$(git splice rebuild <path>)":refs/heads/<branch>

    or check it out in a separate worktree, since it has the upstream's
    layout, not the monorepo's:

      git worktree add ../rebuild "$(git splice rebuild <path>)"
