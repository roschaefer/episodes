usage: git splice push [--upstream <name>] [--force] (<path>... | --all)
       git splice push [--upstream <name>] [--force] --rebuilt-commit <commit> <path>

Publishes each splice's local changes: rebuilds the commits that changed
it since its boundary, without its .splice file, and pushes them to its
upstream URL. Nothing is written to the monorepo.

Bottom-up: a splice below another is pushed first, since the push of the
one above publishes its .splice, and a failed push stops the splices
above it.

If the upstream has no branch named like the current one, push creates it
-- but only if it has commits upstream's default branch lacks, so working
on a feature branch doesn't spawn empty branches upstream. Commits the
feature branch got from the branch it was cut from count too: when
upstream takes changes only through PRs, that's how they get there.

On the monorepo's default branch, a default-pin names a tag or a commit,
which isn't pushed to: push refuses there.

--force overwrites the upstream branch with the monorepo's side: when the
two share no history, or to discard commits only upstream has.

--rebuilt-commit pushes <commit> instead of the rebuild, e.g. one whose
history was edited after 'git splice rebuild <path>' printed it:
messages reworded, commits squashed. Only the history: its files must be
the folder's, and it must contain the synced commit -- with --force, it
may also replace commits the upstream already has. Either way, a pull
must be able to record it: a commit of the rebuild's history that isn't
newer than the synced commit is refused. push checks only that; the
rest of <commit>'s history -- its parents, the files of the commits
before it -- is pushed as it is, as with 'git push'. Like every
push, it records no sync point: the monorepo keeps rebuilding the
original commits, and a later push publishes them too, unless 'git
splice pull --bump <path>' records <commit> as the synced commit before
the next change, as push reminds you.

Only committed changes are pushed; push warns about uncommitted ones in a
splice's folder.

--upstream names one of the upstreams a splice's .splice names; without
it, the splice's default upstream. A splice without the named upstream
stops the command before it starts.
