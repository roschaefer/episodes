# Rebase via monorepo

In the [same state](README.md), `feature` is rebased onto `main` in the
monorepo, and the result replaces the PR:

1. On `main`: `git splice pull`. Done already: *p* brought in *m*.
2. On `feature`: `git rebase main`.
3. `git splice push --force`.

<div align="center">

![Rebase via monorepo, with the monorepo main and feature on the left and the upstream main and feature on the right: 1, on main, git splice pull from the upstream main; 2, on feature, git rebase main; 3, git splice push --force to the upstream feature](../../../docs/images/rebase-via-monorepo.drawio.svg)

</div>

The PR ends up as "Update branch" with a rebase on GitHub would leave
it. `--force` overwrites whatever upstream's `feature` has, so it's for
a PR nobody else pushes to.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../scenarios/readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_feature_branch_behind_default_branch
```

The rebase copies *b* onto *p* as *c*:

```scrut
$ git rebase -q main
```

```scrut
$ git log --graph --format=%s
* b: feature change
* p: pull the dependency update
* a: clone vendor/a
* initial commit
```

A plain `push` refuses: upstream has a commit this branch lacks. That
it's *b'*, the copy of *b* from before the rebase, is for you to know:

```scrut
$ git splice push vendor/a
!!   vendor/a: upstream has commits this branch lacks
!!   Failed: vendor/a
[1]
```

```scrut
$ git splice push --force vendor/a
ok   vendor/a: pushed 125a49b to feature
```

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM" log --graph --format=%s feature
* b: feature change
* m: bump dep
* k: seed
```
