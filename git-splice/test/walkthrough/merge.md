NAME
    git-splice-merge - Splice in fetched upstream changes

SYNOPSIS
    git splice merge [--upstream <name>] [--branch <name> [--track]] [--bump | --rebase] [--no-fork-point] (<path>... | --all)
    git splice merge [<option>...] -m <message> <path>

DESCRIPTION
    Splices already-fetched upstream changes into each splice, as one ordinary
    commit per splice. Never touches the network: run 'git splice fetch'
    first, or 'git splice pull' to do both.

    The upstream branch is the one named like the current branch; on the
    monorepo's default branch, the upstream's default-branch if it has one,
    or the tag or commit its default-pin names.
    --branch names another one for this merge, e.g. the one the default
    branch follows, on a pull request's branch the upstream has none for.
    It doesn't change .splice, and the splices below keep theirs.

    --track also tracks that branch on the monorepo's current branch, as
    'git push -u' does: from then on, every command syncs the splice with
    it there, until --track names another. It's kept in the repository's
    config, as branch.<branch>.splice = <key>:<name>, by the upstream's key
    ('git splice key'), so it stays in this clone, and 'git splice status'
    marks the splices that track one. 'git splice fetch --branch <name>
    --track' tracks one without a merge, and 'git splice fetch --no-track'
    stops tracking it.

    --upstream names one of the upstreams a splice's .splice names; without
    it, the splice's default upstream. A splice without the named upstream
    stops the command before it starts.

    Top-down: a splice is merged before the ones below it, since its merge
    can move their synced commits, and a failure stops them.

    On a conflict, resolve it and run 'git commit' (or 'git cherry-pick
    --abort' to give up), then re-run merge for any splices left. When the two
    sides share no history at all, merge doesn't guess: it prints the commands
    to keep either side.

    When the upstream rewrote its branch, e.g. a fork rebased its patch
    branch onto a new release, merge starts at the branch's fork point, like
    'git pull --rebase': the newest commit the fetched branch pointed at, by
    its reflog, that the folder's history has. Merge then takes the
    rewritten branch as it is. If the folder has changes that branch lacks,
    it refuses: the next push would publish the rewritten-away commits
    again, under them. --rebase redoes them on top instead.
    --no-fork-point merges from Git's merge base instead.

    --bump also moves the synced commit up to the upstream branch when there's
    nothing to merge, e.g. right after a push, in a commit that only changes
    the splice's .splice, like a submodule bump. Later rebuilds then start
    there, instead of rebuilding every pushed commit again.

    --rebase rebases instead, like 'git pull --rebase': it takes the
    upstream branch in on top of the newest commit whose folder has exactly
    the synced commit's files, and rebases the monorepo branch's commits
    since then onto that, with 'git rebase'. The next push then sends the
    folder's changes as commits on top of the upstream branch, also after
    the upstream rewrote it. It rewrites the branch, so it refuses when a
    remote-tracking branch has any of those commits, and when one of them is
    a merge, whose own changes a rebase would drop. It also refuses when the
    upstream branch lacks the synced commit, and its reflog here doesn't
    show it ever had it: the folder would lose that commit's changes. The
    branch may never have had it, e.g. after 'git rebase main' on a feature
    branch, or had it before a rewrite this clone didn't see, e.g. in a
    fresh clone. rebase.autoStash and
    rebase.updateRefs don't apply: it neither stashes nor moves other
    branches. On a conflict, resolve it and run 'git rebase --continue' (or
    'git rebase --abort' to give up).

    -m gives the commit this message instead of the default one, which
    names the upstream branch and commit; with --rebase, the commit the
    rebased ones go on top of. It takes one splice: each gets a commit of
    its own. Nothing reads the message back: .splice records the synced
    commit. On a conflict, 'git commit' keeps the message.
```
In the [walkthrough's repositories](README.md), `vendor/pkg-a/`'s upstream has a commit the
monorepo doesn't have yet, and it's already fetched:

```scrut
$ git splice merge vendor/pkg-a
ok   vendor/pkg-a: merged 703b936
```

The commit `merge` made records the fetched branch, T, as the new synced
commit, U(H). Nothing was waiting to be pushed, so its folder is U(H), and it's
`vendor/pkg-a/`'s new [boundary](boundary.md), B:

```scrut
$ git log -1 --stat --format=%s
splice: merge vendor/pkg-a from main at 703b936

 vendor/pkg-a/.splice  | 2 +-
 vendor/pkg-a/file.txt | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

```scrut
$ git config --file vendor/pkg-a/.splice splice.commit
703b9360f7ac335a1134e9b5771a90a7c09ba39a
```

The upstream's commits stay upstream, and in `refs/splices/`. The
monorepo's history stays linear.

`--bump` also records the upstream branch in `.splice` when there's
nothing to merge, e.g. right after a push. Use it sparingly; see
[bumping the sync point](bump.md).
