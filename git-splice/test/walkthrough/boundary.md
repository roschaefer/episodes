NAME
    git-splice-boundary - Print where a splice's rebuild starts

SYNOPSIS
    git splice boundary <path>

DESCRIPTION
    Prints the commit the rebuild of splice <path> starts from, B. The
    rebuild copies the commits after it on the current branch's
    first-parent history that change the folder's files:

      git log --first-parent "$(git splice boundary <path>)"..HEAD -- <path> ':!<path>/.splice'

    Usually B is the last pull, merge, clone or init. After a pull that
    merged commits that were never pushed, it's an earlier one, where the
    folder was the upstream commit .splice recorded.

    For a nested splice, run it in a worktree of a fetched commit of the
    upstream above, with the path there, to get where that upstream's
    rebuild of it starts:

      git worktree add --detach ../a refs/splices/a/heads/main
      git -C ../a splice boundary b

    Purely local, but the synced commit must have been fetched. Writes no
    ref and no monorepo commit.
```

In the [walkthrough's repositories](README.md), pull `vendor/pkg-a/`,
then add a local commit. Its boundary is the pull commit:

```scrut
$ git splice pull vendor/pkg-a >/dev/null &&
>   echo "a local fix" >>vendor/pkg-a/file.txt &&
>   git commit -qam "pkg-a: a local fix"
```

`boundary` prints that pull:

```scrut
$ git show -s --oneline "$(git splice boundary vendor/pkg-a)"
6ff5bf8 splice: pull vendor/pkg-a from main at 703b936
```

The folder's commits since then, on the first-parent history, are what
`push` rebuilds:

```scrut
$ git log --first-parent --oneline "$(git splice boundary vendor/pkg-a)"..HEAD -- vendor/pkg-a
2774c1a pkg-a: a local fix
```
