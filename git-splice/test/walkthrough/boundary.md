# boundary

`git splice boundary <path>`

Prints the splice boundary, B: the monorepo commit the
[rebuild](rebuild.md) starts from. Like a boundary commit of
`git log --boundary`, it starts the range of the folder's commits that
the rebuild copies. Usually it's the last `pull`, the newest commit on the
first-parent history that changed the splice's `.splice`. After a pull
that merged commits that were never pushed, it's an earlier one, where
the folder was the upstream commit `.splice` recorded
([sync model](../concepts/sync-model/README.md#r-the-rebuild)). To tell,
it compares the folder with that upstream commit, so the splice must
have been fetched.

<!-- Builds a fresh sandbox; see `just docs-check`.
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/scrut-setup.sh"
```
-->

```scrut
$ git splice pull vendor/pkg-a >/dev/null &&
>   echo "a local fix" >>vendor/pkg-a/file.txt &&
>   git commit -qam "pkg-a: a local fix"
```

```scrut
$ git show -s --oneline "$(git splice boundary vendor/pkg-a)"
6ff5bf8 splice: pull vendor/pkg-a from main at 703b936
```

The folder's commits since then, on the first-parent history, are what
`push` rebuilds:

```scrut
$ git log --first-parent --oneline "$(git splice boundary vendor/pkg-a)"..HEAD -- vendor/pkg-a
2774c1a pkg-a: a local fix
```

## Nested splices

A nested splice has two boundaries. In the monorepo, `boundary` prints
where the monorepo's rebuild of it starts, often a pull of the splice
above. Where the upstream above's starts is a commit of that upstream:
check out a fetched commit of it in a worktree, and run `boundary` there
with the path in that upstream, e.g. `b/` for `vendor/a/b/`:

    git worktree add --detach ../a refs/splices/a/heads/main
    git -C ../a splice boundary b
