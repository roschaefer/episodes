# Scenario: init-then-cloned

> **Known bug, [#11](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/11).** This page shows what `git-splice` does today, bug included. See [all known bugs](../../08-known-bugs.md).

A splice made by `init` was published, and a colleague clones the
monorepo. Until the clone fetches, `status`, `merge`, `log` and `diff`
treat the upstream as empty, though it has commits. This is a known bug,
[#11](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/11).

- **Monorepo (`lib/a/`)**: a fresh clone of a monorepo in which `lib/a/` was
  made a splice with `init` and pushed twice.
- **Upstream**: the two pushed commits, `splice: init lib/a` and
  `second version`.

A splice made by `init` records no synced commit, and `push` doesn't write
one. A fresh clone has no fetched refs either, so it can't tell this
splice from one whose upstream is still empty. A splice made by `clone`
records its synced commit, and a fresh clone says it was
[never fetched](../../01-everyday-sync/04-never-fetched/README.md).

Workaround: `git splice fetch` (or `pull`, which fetches) in the clone.
Nothing is lost meanwhile: the rebuild produces the commits the upstream
already has, so a push without a fetch adds to them, or changes nothing.
[A push before the fetch](push-before-fetch.md) shows that, though its
message is wrong too.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_init_then_cloned
```

`.splice` has no synced commit:

```scrut
$ git config --file lib/a/.splice --list
splice.id=[0-9a-f]{16} (regex)
upstream.origin.url=$UPSTREAM
```

`status` takes the splice for new, as if the upstream had no such branch,
though it has:

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  new, ahead 2  lib/a  push creates the branch
```

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM" log --format=%s main
second version
splice: init lib/a
```

`log` shows both published commits as unpushed:

```scrut
$ git splice log
===  lib/a (upstream has no 'main' branch)
< f9832ad second version  (Test <test@example.com>)
< f0fcdd0 splice: init lib/a  (Test <test@example.com>)
```

`merge` finds nothing to merge:

```scrut
$ git splice merge lib/a
ok   lib/a: upstream has no 'main' branch -- nothing to merge
```

`diff` shows the whole folder as a change to push:

```scrut
$ git splice diff
===  lib/a
diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..57be07d
--- /dev/null
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -0,0 +1,2 @@
+first version
+second version
```

After a fetch, the clone sees the upstream as it is:

```scrut
$ git splice fetch
ok   lib/a fetched
```

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  lib/a
```
