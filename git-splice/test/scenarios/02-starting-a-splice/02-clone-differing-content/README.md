# Scenario: clone-differing-content

A folder maintained by hand, and an upstream with different content.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: `file.txt` and `local.txt`.
- **Upstream**: `file.txt` with other content, and `upstream.txt`.

The two share no history, so there is no merge base but an empty folder.
`clone` refuses, unless `--merge` is given: then every file that differs is
a conflict, and nothing is lost.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_clone_differing_content
```

```scrut
$ git splice clone "$UPSTREAM" vendor/a
===  vendor/a: fetching $UPSTREAM
!!   vendor/a exists and differs from 'main' upstream -- '--merge' keeps both, and every file that differs becomes a conflict to resolve
[1]
```

```scrut
$ git splice clone --merge "$UPSTREAM" vendor/a
===  vendor/a: fetching $UPSTREAM
Auto-merging vendor/a/file.txt
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in vendor/a/file.txt
!!   vendor/a: conflict -- resolve it, then 'git commit' (or 'git cherry-pick --abort' to give up)
!!   vendor/a: clone failed
[1]
```

Files only one side has are kept, the file both have conflicts:

```scrut
$ git status --short
A  vendor/a/.splice
AA vendor/a/file.txt
A  vendor/a/upstream.txt
```

```scrut
$ echo "both versions" >vendor/a/file.txt &&
>   git add vendor/a/file.txt &&
>   git commit -q --no-edit
```

The push sends one commit, the merge, on top of upstream's. The folder's
history from before it was a splice stays in the monorepo
([why](../04-init-new-upstream/01-removed-before-init/README.md)):

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  ahead 1  vendor/a
```
