# Scenario: many-splices

A monorepo with five splices, each in a different state, on the
monorepo's default branch.

- **Monorepo (`libs/*`)**: *a* to *e* add `cli`, `http`, `parser`, `store`
  and `theme`, each from its own upstream's `seed`. Then a local commit
  in `parser`, *f*, and one in `store`, *g*.
- **Upstreams**: two new commits in `http`'s, *m* and *n*, one in
  `store`'s, *o*. `theme`'s default branch is `master`.

`status` gives every splice a line. Those that need something come first,
most urgent first: diverged, then behind, then ahead. Those with nothing
to do come last, after a blank line. A splice names its upstream branch
only where it differs from the monorepo's, like `theme`'s `master`.

The other documents here show the same monorepo
[on a feature branch](feature-branch.md),
[with uncommitted changes](uncommitted-changes.md) and
[in a fresh clone](fresh-clone.md).

<div align="center">

![Monorepo commits a to g, and one lane per splice: cli up to date, http behind by m and n, parser ahead by f prime, store diverged with o and g prime, theme up to date](many-splices.drawio.svg)

</div>

Each splice has a lane, labelled with its folder. *f'* and *g'* are R's
copies of *f* and *g*.
