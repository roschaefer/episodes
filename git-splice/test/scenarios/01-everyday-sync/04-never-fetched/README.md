# Scenario: never-fetched

A splice whose upstream hasn't been fetched in this clone yet, as right
after cloning the monorepo: the commits are there, the private refs with
upstream's branches aren't.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: cloned at `seed`.
- **Upstream**: `seed`, never fetched here.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
