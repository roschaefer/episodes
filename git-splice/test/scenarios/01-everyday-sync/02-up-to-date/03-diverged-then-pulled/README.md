# Scenario: diverged-then-pulled

Both sides changed different files, then upstream's change was pulled in.
The local change is still waiting to be pushed.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: cloned at `seed`, a local commit adding
  `local.txt`, then `git splice pull`, which merged cleanly.
- **Upstream**: `seed`, then a commit adding `upstream.txt`. It has never
  seen `local.txt`.

The pull's commit is the newest that changed `.splice`, but its folder
differs from the synced commit: it contains `local.txt`. So the boundary
stays the clone, and the push rebuilds the pull as a merge
of the local commit with upstream's, and the local commit keeps its own
identity upstream.
