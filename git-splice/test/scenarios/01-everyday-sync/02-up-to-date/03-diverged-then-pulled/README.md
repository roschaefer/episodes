# Scenario: diverged-then-pulled

Both sides changed different files, then upstream's change was pulled in.
The local change is still waiting to be pushed. *b* adds `local.txt`,
*l* adds `upstream.txt`, and the pull, *e*, merged cleanly:

<div align="center">

![The monorepo commits a, b and the pull e, with B at a; upstream k and l, T; the rebuild b prime on top of k, and e prime, R, a merge of b prime and l](diverged-then-pulled.drawio.svg)

</div>

The pull's folder differs from *l*, the commit it records: it contains
`local.txt`. So B stays at the clone, and the push rebuilds the pull as
a merge, and the local commit keeps its own identity upstream.
