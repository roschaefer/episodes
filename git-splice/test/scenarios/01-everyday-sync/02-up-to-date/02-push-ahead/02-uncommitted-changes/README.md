# Scenario: uncommitted-changes

The splice's folder has a committed change and an uncommitted one. Like
every command, `push` reads the splice from the last commit, so it sends
only the committed change.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: cloned at `seed`, then a local commit, then
  an edit to `file.txt` that isn't committed.
- **Upstream**: `seed`, unchanged.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../../../readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_uncommitted_changes
```

`status` shows the committed change, and warns about the uncommitted one:

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  ahead 1  vendor/a  uncommitted changes
```

`push` warns too, and sends what is committed:

```scrut
$ git splice push vendor/a
??   vendor/a: uncommitted changes aren't pushed -- commit them first
ok   vendor/a: pushed e859a6b to main
```

The upstream now matches the last commit, but the edit is still only in
the folder:

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a  uncommitted changes
```

Committing it makes it pushable:

```scrut
$ git commit -q -am "uncommitted change" && git splice push vendor/a
ok   vendor/a: pushed 76bcc31 to main
```

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a
```
