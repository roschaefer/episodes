# Scenario: pushed-then-pulled

The monorepo pushed a change. Pulling right after the push brings nothing
in, and `.splice` keeps the commit it had before the push. Only a pull that
brings in an upstream change moves it.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: cloned at `seed`, then a local commit, pushed
  with `git splice push`.
- **Upstream**: `seed`, then the pushed commit.
- **Synced commit**: still `seed`.

A push never writes to the monorepo
([why](../../../../../concepts/sync-model/README.md#why-a-push-isnt-recorded)).
[bump-after-push](bump-after-push.md) shows what bumping after the push
changes, with `git splice pull --bump`
([#115](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/115)).

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../../../readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_pushed_then_pulled
```

The upstream has the pushed commit:

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM" log --format='%h %s' main
e859a6b local change
bde4164 seed
```

`.splice` still names `seed`, the commit from before the push:

```scrut
$ git log -1 --format='%h %s' "$(git config --file vendor/a/.splice splice.commit)"
bde4164 seed
```

Yet the splice is up to date, because the folder's content equals the
upstream's:

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a
```

So a pull right after the push has nothing to bring in, and doesn't change
`.splice`:

```scrut
$ git splice pull vendor/a
ok   vendor/a fetched
ok   vendor/a: nothing to pull
```

```scrut
$ git log -1 --format='%h %s' "$(git config --file vendor/a/.splice splice.commit)"
bde4164 seed
```

Once someone else pushes to the upstream, the next pull brings their commit
in. It merges from the pushed commit, so the local change isn't applied a
second time:

```scrut
$ seed_bare_repo "$UPSTREAM" "upstream change"
```

```scrut
$ git splice pull vendor/a
ok   vendor/a fetched (main moved e859a6b..de87439)
ok   vendor/a: pulled de87439
```

Now `.splice` names the upstream's new tip, in the pull's commit:

```scrut
$ git log -1 --format='%h %s' "$(git config --file vendor/a/.splice splice.commit)"
de87439 upstream change
```

```scrut
$ git log --format=%s
splice: pull vendor/a from main at de87439
local change
add vendor/a
initial commit
```
