# Scenario: pushed-then-changed

The monorepo pushed a change, then changed the splice again. Upstream has
nothing but that push.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: cloned at `seed`, a commit pushed with `git
  splice push`, then another local commit.
- **Upstream**: `seed`, then the pushed commit.
- **Synced commit**: still `seed` -- a push doesn't write to the monorepo.

The rebuild is deterministic, so it rebuilds the pushed commit exactly.
Upstream's tip is an ancestor of the rebuild, and the next push
fast-forwards it.
