# Scenarios

Each folder here is one reusable test setup: a state a splice and its
upstream can be in, or a situation a command has to handle. A folder may
contain several Markdown documents, but each document explains and executes
one problem. `status`'s [sync states](../walkthrough/status.md#sync-states)
link to them as examples. Some show a bug as it is today; [Known
bugs](08-known-bugs.md) lists them.

The scenarios are grouped into numbered chapters by topic, from the
situations every user meets to the edge cases: everyday sync, starting a
splice, branches and teamwork, upstreams, nested splices, rewritten
history, and moved folders. Within a chapter, the numbers order the
scenarios the same way. The site drops the numbers from its URLs, and
takes a chapter's name from its `_category_.json`.

A scenario folder has:

- `setup.bash` defines one function, named after the folder without its
  number (`scenario_pull_ahead` in `01-pull-ahead/`). Given two paths, it builds a
  monorepo and a bare repository as its upstream in that state, out of the
  helpers in [`test/helpers/fixtures.bash`](../helpers/fixtures.bash). The
  bats tests and every document in the folder share that setup.
- Child folders, for scenarios that continue from this one. A child's
  `setup.bash` sources only its parent's, calls the parent's function, and
  adds its own steps: `02-up-to-date/02-push-ahead/` is `02-up-to-date/`
  plus one local commit. A scenario that continues from one in an earlier
  chapter sits at the top of its own chapter and sources that scenario's
  `setup.bash` instead: `03-branches-and-teamwork/01-feature-branch-unchanged/`
  builds on `01-everyday-sync/02-up-to-date/`. A document only calls its
  own folder's setup, so following the `source` lines shows every step.
- One or more `.md` files. Each describes one behavior and shows what the
  tool prints under "Output".

## Every scenario

This check lists every scenario folder, with how many documents it has.
It fails if a `setup.bash` sources anything but its parent's, or, at the
top of a chapter, more than one other scenario's, or doesn't define the
function named after its folder, or if a document doesn't link
to its setup or doesn't call that function first:

## The output is real

As on every page with output, [scrut](../../docs/sandbox.md#the-output-is-real)
runs the commands. Under "Output", each document first calls its
folder's scenario function, so it runs in the state the bats tests use:

    $ build_scenario scenario_pull_ahead

`build_scenario` runs the function with a monorepo and an upstream, hides
what it prints, and changes into the monorepo. It comes from
[`readme-setup.sh`](readme-setup.sh). The splice is `vendor/a/` unless
the document says otherwise, and the upstream's path shows as
`$UPSTREAM`.

## Adding a scenario

1. Pick the chapter, and a number that puts the scenario between the
   more common and the rarer ones; renumber the folders after it. Create
   `<chapter>/<NN>-<name>/setup.bash` with a function `scenario_<name>`,
   with `_` for `-`. If it continues from a scenario in the same chapter,
   create it inside that scenario's folder, source `../setup.bash` and
   call the parent's function first. If that scenario is in another
   chapter, source its `setup.bash` by its path from `../../` instead.
2. Write one `.md` file per behavior. Copy the "Output" start from another
   scenario at the same depth, change the function name, and add a `scrut`
   block per command with just its `$ ` line.
3. Run `just docs-check --write` to fill in the output, including the
   new folder's line under "Every scenario". Read it: it's the
   documentation, so it has to say what the prose claims. Run
   `just docs-check` once more: output that differs between runs is a
   bug in the setup.
4. Add a bats test that asserts the state, e.g. in `test/status.bats`.
