# Scenario: feature-branch-from-main

The monorepo's `main` has a commit that upstream's `main` lacks, and the
monorepo is on a branch cut from it. Upstream protects its `main`, say, so
changes only go in through a PR from another branch.

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a and b, the upstream's k on main, and R, the rebuilt b prime on top of k; there is no T](feature-branch-from-main.drawio.svg)

</div>

- **Upstream**: only `main`, at *k* (`seed`).
- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: *a* (`add vendor/a`) cloned *k* on `main`, then
  a local commit *b* (`local change`), then the branch `feature` without
  further changes.

Upstream has no `feature` branch, so there's no T. The splice didn't
change on `feature`, but `feature` has *b*, which upstream's `main` lacks:
R's copy *b'* is dashed, no upstream branch has it yet. That's what counts, as for a PR: `push` creates
`feature` upstream with it, ready for one (#150).
