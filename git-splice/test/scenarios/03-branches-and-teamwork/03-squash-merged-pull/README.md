# Scenario: squash-merged-pull

A pull on a feature branch, squash-merged into `main`.

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a, the squash merge s and c; the upstream's k on main and f on feature; R is c prime on top of f, and B is s](squash-merged-pull.drawio.svg)

</div>

- **Upstream**: *k* (`seed`) on `main`, and someone else's commit *f*
  (`upstream feature work`) on `feature`.
- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: *a* (`add vendor/a`) cloned *k*. On `feature`,
  `git splice pull` brought in *f*. `feature` was squash-merged into `main`
  as *s* and deleted, then a local commit *c* followed on `main`.

`.splice` records a commit, not a branch: *s* records *f* as U(H). The
upstream's `main`, T, is still at *k*, since nobody merged `feature` into
it there. *f* is on the upstream's `feature`, so it's solid. R's copy *c'*
is dashed: no upstream branch has it yet.

A squash merge keeps the content and drops the history. With `git subtree`,
that lost the sync point. Here *s* itself changed `.splice`, so it is B, and
the rebuild starts at *f*: R is *c'*, the copy of *c*, on top of *f*.
