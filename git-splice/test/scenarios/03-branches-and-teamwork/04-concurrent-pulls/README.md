# Scenario: concurrent-pulls

Two developers pull the same splice on `main` at different times. Each
pull writes a commit that changes the same line of `.splice`, the synced
commit, and the same lines of the files the upstream changed. When the
second developer merges the first one's work, Git reports conflicts in
both.

- **Upstream**: *k* (`seed`), *l* (`upstream 1`), *n* (`upstream 2`).
- **Alice's monorepo**, pushed as `origin/main`: *a* cloned *k*, then her
  pull *q* brought in *l*.
- **Bob's monorepo**, this one: from *a*, his pull *p* brought in *n*, without
  pulling the monorepo first.

<div align="center">

![The clone a with two children: Bob's pull p, which is H and B and whose .splice records n, and Alice's pull q on origin/main, whose .splice records l; upstream k, l and n, with T and R at n](concurrent-pulls.drawio.svg)

</div>

*p* and *q* each change the line of `.splice` that records the synced
commit, from *k* to *n* and to *l*: U(p) and U(q) show what each one records.

To avoid this, pull the monorepo before you pull a splice. To get out of
it, resolve the conflict as below, or [redo the pull](redo-the-pull.md).
If `.splice` is committed with conflict markers anyway,
[every command stops](committed-conflict-markers.md) until it's fixed.

```scrut

```

```scrut
$ git status --short
UU vendor/a/.splice
UU vendor/a/file.txt
```

Both sides changed the synced commit (`expand` shows the tabs as spaces):

```scrut
$ expand vendor/a/.splice
[splice]
        id = 224f2c2563d3b6f7
<<<<<<< HEAD
        commit = 4c1905de64f0df0a488c0b63482302ec229fdce9
=======
        commit = 72efaacc5c6b50e5d2a6fe51a30af958c8adae51
>>>>>>> origin/main
[upstream "origin"]
        url = https://git.example.com/a.git
```

While the merge is in progress, `pull` and `merge` refuse to start.
`status`, `log`, `diff` and `push` read the last commit, not the
conflicted files, so they still show the state from before the merge.
`status` adds that the folder has uncommitted changes, the conflicted
files:

```scrut
$ git splice pull vendor/a
!!   a cherry-pick, merge or rebase is in progress -- conclude it first
[1]
```

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a  uncommitted changes
```

### Resolving

Keep the newer sync point: the one whose history contains the other's.
The fetched upstream branch shows both, newest first: Bob's `upstream 2`
contains Alice's `upstream 1`:

```scrut
$ git log --format='%h %s' splices/a/heads/main
4c1905d upstream 2
72efaac upstream 1
bde4164 seed
```

Only the upstream changed the folder on both sides, so the whole folder
is resolved to Bob's side, `--ours`, which has the newer sync point. Had
Alice also changed files in the folder herself, those would need resolving
by hand, but `.splice` would still take the newer sync point:

```scrut
$ git checkout --ours -- vendor/a && git add vendor/a
```

`git diff --check` finds leftover conflict markers, and `git config`
refuses a `.splice` it can't read:

```scrut
$ git diff --cached --check && git config --file vendor/a/.splice --list
splice.id=224f2c2563d3b6f7
splice.commit=4c1905de64f0df0a488c0b63482302ec229fdce9
upstream.origin.url=https://git.example.com/a.git
```

```scrut
$ git commit -q --no-edit && git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a
```
