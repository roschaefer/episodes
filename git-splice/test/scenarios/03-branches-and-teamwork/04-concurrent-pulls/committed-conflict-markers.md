# Committed conflict markers

In the [same state](README.md), the conflict in `vendor/a/.splice` is
committed with its markers. `git-splice` reads `.splice` with `git config`,
which can't read past the first marker. So every command stops with Git's
message, before a half-read `.splice` could make the splice look
unrelated to its upstream and suggest `push --force`
([#37](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/37)).

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_concurrent_pulls
```

The folder's files are resolved, `.splice` isn't:

```scrut
$ git merge origin/main >/dev/null
> git checkout --ours -- vendor/a/file.txt &&
>   git add vendor/a &&
>   git commit -q --no-edit
```

`git config` can't read it:

```scrut
$ git config --blob HEAD:vendor/a/.splice --get splice.commit
error: bad config line 3 in blob HEAD:vendor/a/.splice
[1]
```

Neither can `git-splice`, so it stops:

```scrut
$ git splice status
!!   vendor/a/.splice can't be read (bad config line 3 in blob HEAD:vendor/a/.splice) -- fix it and commit it
[1]
```

```scrut
$ git splice merge vendor/a
!!   vendor/a/.splice can't be read (bad config line 3 in blob HEAD:vendor/a/.splice) -- fix it and commit it
[1]
```

The fix is a readable `.splice` with the newer sync point. Here, the merge's
first parent has it:

```scrut
$ git checkout HEAD~1^1 -- vendor/a/.splice &&
>   git commit -q -m "fix vendor/a/.splice" &&
>   git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a
```
