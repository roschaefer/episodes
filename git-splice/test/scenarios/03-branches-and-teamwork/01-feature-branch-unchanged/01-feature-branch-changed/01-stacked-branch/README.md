# Scenario: stacked-branch

A branch stacked on a feature branch that upstream already has, and the
splice didn't change on the stacked branch.

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a, b and c; the upstream's k on main and b prime on feature; R is b prime, and there is no T](stacked-branch.drawio.svg)

</div>

- **Upstream**: *k* (`seed`) on `main`, and *b'*, the copy of *b*, on `feature`
  from the push.
- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: *a* (`add vendor/a`) cloned *k*. On `feature`,
  a local commit *b* (`local change`) under `vendor/a/`, pushed; then the
  branch `stacked` on top, with a commit *c* (`app work`) outside
  `vendor/a/` only.

Upstream has no `stacked` branch, so there's no T, and `git-splice`
compares with upstream's default branch, as a PR from `stacked` would. R
is *b'*, the commit `feature` has, so it's solid. `main` lacks it, so the
splice counts as new, and `push` creates `stacked` upstream at *b'*, the
same commit as `feature`. A PR from it into
`main` would show the same change as the PR from `feature`; one into
`feature` would be empty. That's the cost of comparing with the default
branch (#150): pushing only the splices that changed on `stacked`, here
none, avoids it.
