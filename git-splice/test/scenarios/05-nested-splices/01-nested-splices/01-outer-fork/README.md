# Scenario: outer-fork

The splice above has a second upstream, the one below doesn't
([#107](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/107)). As in
[nested-splices](../README.md), the outer upstream is spliced in at
`vendor/a/`, and the inner one at `vendor/a/b/`. The outer upstream's
company fork carries a patch to `b/`.

- **Inner upstream** (reached as `https://git.example.com/b.git`):
  `b seed`.
- **Outer upstream** (`$UPSTREAM`): `a seed`, then `add b`.
- **Outer fork** (`$UPSTREAM-fork.git`, reached as
  `https://git.example.com/company/a.git`): a copy of the outer
  upstream, then `a fork patch to b`, which changes `b/file.txt`.
  [fork-default-branch-below](fork-default-branch-below.md) renames its
  `main` to `trunk`.
- **Inner fork** (`$UPSTREAM-b-fork.git`, reached as
  `https://git.example.com/company/b.git`): a copy of the inner
  upstream, then `b fork patch`. Only
  [same-name-below](same-name-below.md) uses it.
- **Monorepo**: `vendor/a/` and `vendor/a/b/`, as in
  [nested-splices](../README.md).

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_outer_fork https://git.example.com/b.git
```

`vendor/a/.splice` gets the outer fork as a second upstream, and keeps
the outer upstream as its default:

```scrut
$ git config --file vendor/a/.splice upstream.fork.url https://git.example.com/company/a.git &&
>   git config --file vendor/a/.splice splice.default-upstream origin &&
>   git commit -q -m "vendor/a: add the company fork" -- vendor/a/.splice
```

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a -> origin/main
  up to date  vendor/a/b
```

### `--upstream` applies to the splices named

`vendor/a/b/.splice` names no `fork`, so every splice can't pull from
one:

```scrut
$ git splice pull --upstream fork --all
!!   no upstream 'fork' in vendor/a/b -- name only the splices that have one: vendor/a
[1]
```

Only `vendor/a/`, then. Its pull also fetches the splice below it, whose
synced commit the pull may move: from every upstream it names, since
which of them has the new one isn't known. For `vendor/a/b/`, that's its
only one:

```scrut
$ git splice pull --upstream fork vendor/a
ok   vendor/a fetched from fork
ok   vendor/a/b fetched
ok   vendor/a: pulled 1b1cea6
```

The fork's patch to `b/` is in `vendor/a/b/` now. Its `.splice` didn't
change, so the patch is a local change to `vendor/a/b/`: the next push
sends it to the inner upstream, as if it had been made in the monorepo.
For `vendor/a/`, it's a commit the outer upstream lacks, like any other
the fork has.

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  ahead 1  vendor/a -> origin/main
  ahead 1  vendor/a/b
```

```scrut
$ git splice log vendor/a/b
===  vendor/a/b (main)
< c163a9d a fork patch to b  (Test <test@example.com>)
```

### Both upstreams of `vendor/a/` afterwards

*c* (`vendor/a: add the company fork`) named the fork, and *p* pulled
*q* (`a fork patch to b`) from it. The outer upstream and its fork share
*k* and *l*, so the drawing shows them on each side of the dashed line.
Only the fork has *q*. In `vendor/a/b/`, the patch is *q'*, dashed: the
inner upstream lacks it, and the next push of `vendor/a/b/` sends it.
