# Scenario: nested-splices, the two splices swap their `.splice`

> **Known bug, [#174](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/174).** This page shows what `git-splice` does today, bug included. See [all known bugs](../../08-known-bugs.md).

The outer splice contains the inner one, as in the [README](README.md).
Then the two `.splice` files trade places, ids and URLs included: the
folder `vendor/a/` names the inner upstream, and `vendor/a/b/` names the
outer one.

```text
before:  vendor/a    id a, a's upstream      after:  vendor/a    id b, b's upstream
           b/        id b, b's upstream                b/        id a, a's upstream
```

Nobody planned for this. This page records what `git-splice` does, as it
is:

- **Nothing refuses it.** No id repeats in one line of nesting, so it
  isn't a cycle either, a splice that contains itself
  ([#86](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/86)).
- **Each path starts a new history at the swap**, since its `.splice`
  has another id there. Nothing from before it reaches the other
  upstream.
- **But a push replaces the upstream's files.** The swap reads as a
  plain `ahead 1`, and pushing `vendor/a` sends the outer upstream's
  files to the inner upstream, as a fast-forward. `clone` refuses a
  folder whose files differ from the upstream's, without `--merge`; a
  hand-edited `.splice` skips that check
  ([#174](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/174)).
- **A later pull of the folder below doesn't nest the outer upstream
  again.** The swap removed the outer upstream's `b/` from it, so the
  merge keeps it removed.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../readme-setup.sh" && export GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0="url.$UPSTREAM-b.git.insteadOf" GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=https://git.example.com/b.git
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds the state of the [README](README.md):
the outer upstream with the inner one spliced in at `b/`, cloned into
the monorepo:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_nested_splices https://git.example.com/b.git
```

```scrut
$ git grep -e 'id = ' -e 'url = ' -- '*/.splice' | tr '\t' ' '
vendor/a/.splice: id = [0-9a-f]{16} (regex)
vendor/a/.splice: url = $UPSTREAM
vendor/a/b/.splice: id = 548ac82ad47ea22d
vendor/a/b/.splice: url = https://git.example.com/b.git
```

## The swap

```scrut
$ git mv vendor/a/.splice tmp.splice &&
>   git mv vendor/a/b/.splice vendor/a/.splice &&
>   git mv tmp.splice vendor/a/b/.splice &&
>   git commit -q -m "swap the .splice files"
```

```scrut
$ git grep -e 'id = ' -e 'url = ' -- '*/.splice' | tr '\t' ' '
vendor/a/.splice: id = 548ac82ad47ea22d
vendor/a/.splice: url = https://git.example.com/b.git
vendor/a/b/.splice: id = [0-9a-f]{16} (regex)
vendor/a/b/.splice: url = $UPSTREAM
```

Both read as an ordinary push, each starting at the swap:

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  ahead 1  vendor/a
  ahead 1  vendor/a/b
```

```scrut
$ git splice log
===  vendor/a (main)
< [0-9a-f]{7} swap the \.splice files  \(Test <test@example\.com>\) (regex)
===  vendor/a/b (main)
< bbd74e2 swap the .splice files  (Test <test@example.com>)
```

## A push replaces the inner upstream's files

The inner upstream before:

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM-b.git" ls-tree -r --name-only main
file.txt
```

```scrut
$ git splice push vendor/a
ok   vendor/a: pushed [0-9a-f]{7} to main (regex)
```

After, it has the outer upstream's files, and a nested splice of the
outer upstream:

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM-b.git" ls-tree -r --name-only main
b/.splice
b/file.txt
file.txt
```

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM-b.git" show main:file.txt
a seed
```

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM-b.git" log --format=%s main
swap the .splice files
b seed
```

## A pull of the folder below

The outer upstream moves on, still with the inner one nested in it:

```scrut
$ seed_bare_repo "$UPSTREAM" "a moves on" >/dev/null 2>&1 &&
>   git -C "$UPSTREAM" ls-tree -r --name-only main
b/.splice
b/file.txt
file.txt
```

The pull of `vendor/a/b`, the outer upstream's splice now, conflicts on
`file.txt`, which has the inner upstream's lines here and the outer
upstream's there. The outer upstream's `b/` doesn't come back:

```scrut
$ git splice pull vendor/a/b
ok   vendor/a/b fetched (main moved ddf42f3..a5da290)
Auto-merging vendor/a/b/file.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in vendor/a/b/file.txt
!!   vendor/a/b: conflict -- resolve it, then 'git commit' (or 'git cherry-pick --abort' to give up)
!!   vendor/a/b: pull failed
!!   Failed: vendor/a/b
[1]
```

```scrut
$ git status --short
M  vendor/a/b/.splice
UU vendor/a/b/file.txt
```
