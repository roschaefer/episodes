# Scenario: patch-branch-rebased

A fork carries patches of its own on a branch, `patches`, on top of the
upstream's `main`, and the monorepo's `main` follows that branch
instead of the upstream's `main`. When the upstream releases, the fork
rebases `patches` onto the new `main`. Patches the upstream took drop
out, the others get new commits. Either way, the commit the monorepo
synced last is on no upstream branch any more
([#169](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/169)).

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: *a* (`add vendor/a`) cloned *p* from
  `patches`, and follows `patches` on `main`.
- **Upstream**: *k* (`seed`) on `main`, and *p* (`patch`) on top of it
  on `patches`. Then `main` takes the patch reworded, *m* (`patch,
  reworded upstream`), and `patches` is rebased onto it: the patch drops
  out, so `patches` is *m* too. Already fetched.

![The monorepo's a records p, the old patch on top of k; T is m, the reworded patch on top of k](patch-branch-rebased.drawio.svg)

</div>

U(H) is *p*, but T is *m*, and no upstream branch has *p* any more, so
it's dashed. Git's merge base of the two is *k*, from before the patch:
merging from there, the patch and its rewording would be changes on
both sides, and conflict. Like `git pull --rebase`, a `pull` merges
from the branch's fork point instead: where the fetched `patches` was
before the rebase, *p*, as the ref's reflog has it. Those are the files
the monorepo took last, so the upstream's new version simply replaces
them.

Another upstream's commit, like a fork's patch the original never had,
isn't rewritten away: the original's fetched branch never pointed at it
([original-without-the-patch](../../04-upstreams/02-several-upstreams/01-original-without-the-patch/README.md)).

The reflog is local, as in Git: a clone of the monorepo that first
fetched after the rebase has no *p* in it, and its pull conflicts as
`git merge` would. So does `git splice pull --no-fork-point`.

That's only safe as long as everything the monorepo changed in the
folder is pushed, so the rebased branch has it. An [unpushed local
commit](01-unpushed-local-commit/README.md) is a different story.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_patch_branch_rebased
```

On the monorepo's default branch, a splice syncs with its upstream's
`default-branch`. Setting it to the fork's patch branch makes `main`
follow that branch, for `pull`, `push` and `status` alike:

```scrut
$ git config --file vendor/a/.splice --list
splice.commit=2aff4fd3680b50c26e359216c93491b6a1b039b6
splice.id=[0-9a-f]{16} (regex)
upstream.origin.url=$UPSTREAM
upstream.origin.default-branch=patches
```

The drawing shows what Git and `git-splice` say about it, with each
commit named by its place in the history
([`check_drawing`](../../../../check-drawing/)):

```scrut
$ p="$(git config --file vendor/a/.splice splice.commit)"
```

```scrut
$ check_drawing "$TESTDIR/patch-branch-rebased.drawio.svg" a=HEAD k="$p~1" p="$p" m=refs/splices/upstream/patches
ok   patch-branch-rebased.drawio.svg: 4 commits, 5 arrows, 3 boxes, 1 lanes
```

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM" log --format=%s patches
patch, reworded upstream
seed
```

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  ahead 1, behind 1  vendor/a -> patches
```

`ahead 1` is *p*: the rebased branch lacks it, though the monorepo has
nothing to push. That count is misleading after a rewrite upstream.

The fetched branch's reflog has both *m* and *p*, where `patches` was
before:

```scrut
$ git log -g --format=%s refs/splices/upstream/patches
patch, reworded upstream
patch
```

```scrut
$ [ "$(git merge-base --fork-point refs/splices/upstream/patches "$(git splice rebuild vendor/a)")" = "$p" ] && echo "the fork point is p"
the fork point is p
```

```scrut
$ git splice pull vendor/a
ok   vendor/a fetched
ok   vendor/a: pulled 97171d6
```

The folder has the upstream's version of the patch, and nothing else
changed:

```scrut
$ cat vendor/a/file.txt
seed
patch, reworded upstream
```

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a -> patches
```

R, what a push would send, is the upstream's branch itself: the old
patch, *p*, doesn't come back.

```scrut
$ [ "$(git splice rebuild vendor/a)" = "$(git rev-parse refs/splices/upstream/patches)" ] && echo "R is T"
R is T
```

Why one `pull` is enough: since it took *p*, the monorepo changed
nothing in `vendor/a/`. Merging from *p*, only the upstream changed
something, from *p* to *m*, so the merge takes all of it, without a
conflict. From *k*, Git's merge base, the patch would be a change on
both sides. The pull, *x*, then records *m* in `.splice`: H and B are
*x*, U(H) = U(B) = *m*. The rebuild starts at *m* and adds nothing, so
R is T, and `status` has nothing ahead. *p* is in neither history any
more:

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a and the pull x, H and B; upstream, m on top of k is T, R, U(H) and U(B); p, dashed, on top of k, is left behind](pulled.drawio.svg)

</div>

<!--
```scrut
$ check_drawing "$TESTDIR/pulled.drawio.svg" a=HEAD~1 x=HEAD k="$p~1" p="$p" m=refs/splices/upstream/patches
ok   pulled.drawio.svg: 5 commits, 5 arrows, 2 boxes, 1 lanes
```
