# Scenario: unpushed-local-commit

The [same state](../README.md), but the monorepo changed the folder
after *a*, and didn't push the change before the fork rebased
`patches`.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: *a* (`add vendor/a`) cloned *p*, then the
  unpushed commit *b* (`local change`), which adds `local.txt`.
- **Upstream**: as before, `patches` rebased from *p* onto *m*.

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a and b; R is b prime on top of p, the old patch; T is m, the reworded patch](unpushed-local-commit.drawio.svg)

</div>

R, what a push would send, is *b'* on top of U(H), *p*: the old patch,
which the upstream dropped. A merge would get the files right, *m*'s
plus `local.txt`, but the rebuild can only start at T again where the
folder has exactly T's files. Here it would join *b'* in, and the next
push would publish *p* again, the patch the upstream dropped, merged into
the rebased `patches`. So `pull` refuses.

The way out: [redo the local change on top](redo-on-top.md) of the
rebased branch. Or avoid it: push the local commits before the fork
rebases its branch. The rebased branch then has them, and the pull
[goes through](../README.md).
