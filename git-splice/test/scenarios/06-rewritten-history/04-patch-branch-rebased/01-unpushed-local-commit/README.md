# Scenario: unpushed-local-commit

The [same state](../README.md), but the monorepo changed the folder
after *a*, and didn't push the change before the fork rebased
`patches`.

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: *a* (`add vendor/a`) cloned *q*, then the
  unpushed commit *b* (`local change`), which adds `local.txt`.
- **Upstream**: as before, `patches` rebased from *q* to *n*, on top of
  *m*, the reworded first patch.

Before the pull:

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a and b; R is b prime on top of q, the old patches; T is n, the rebased ones](unpushed-local-commit.drawio.svg)

</div>

R, what a push would send, is *b'* on top of U(H), *q*: the old
patches, which the rebase replaced. A merge would get the files right,
*n*'s plus `local.txt`, but the rebuild can only start at T again where
the folder has exactly T's files. Here it would join *b'* in, and the
next push would publish *p* and *q* again, merged into the rebased
`patches`. So `pull` refuses.

The way out: `git splice pull --rebase` takes *n* in as the pull *x* on
top of *a*, and rebases *b* onto it as *c*. The folder at *x* has
exactly *n*'s files, so the rebuild starts at *n*, and R is *c'*, *c*'s
copy on top of *n*: the next push sends the local change alone, and *p*
and *q* stay dropped. It rewrites the monorepo's branch, so it's for a
branch nobody else has yet: it refuses when a remote-tracking branch
has *b*. After the pull:

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a, x and c, H and main at c, B at x; R is c prime, dashed, on top of n, which is T, U(H), U(B) and patches; m is main; p and q, dashed, are left behind on k](rebased-onto-pull.drawio.svg)

</div>

Or avoid the refusal: push the local commits before the fork rebases
its branch. The rebased branch then has them, and the pull [goes
through](../README.md).

```scrut

!!   vendor/a: upstream rewrote 'patches' since 05c1bab, and the folder has changes 'patches' lacks -- run 'git splice pull --rebase vendor/a' to redo them on top: a pull now would publish the rewritten-away commits again with the next push
!!   Failed: vendor/a

```

Nothing changed:

```scrut
$ git log --format=%s
local change
add vendor/a
initial commit
```

### Redo the local change on top

With `--rebase`, the pull goes through:

```scrut
$ git splice pull --rebase vendor/a
ok   vendor/a fetched
ok   vendor/a: pulled 63b44f3, and rebased 1 commit onto it
```

<!--
```scrut
$ check_drawing "$TESTDIR/rebased-onto-pull.drawio.svg" a=HEAD~2 x=HEAD~1 c=HEAD \
>   k="$q~2" p="$q~1" q="$q" m=refs/splices/upstream/heads/main n=refs/splices/upstream/heads/patches
ok   rebased-onto-pull.drawio.svg: 9 commits, 13 arrows, 6 boxes, 1 lanes
```
-->

Only the local change is ahead now, and the pull comes before it:

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  ahead 1  vendor/a -> patches
```

```scrut
$ git log --format=%s
local change
splice: pull vendor/a from patches at 63b44f3
add vendor/a
initial commit
```

```scrut
$ git splice push vendor/a
ok   vendor/a: pushed 83e98ce to patches
```

The rebased branch gets the change on top, and *p* and *q* stay
dropped:

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM" log --format=%s patches
local change
other patch
patch, reworded upstream
seed
```

After the push, *c'* is on `patches`, so it's T as well as R. The push
records nothing, so U(H) is still *n*, the commit the pull took, until
the next pull:

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a, x and c in a line, H and main at c, B at x; upstream, c prime on top of n on top of m on top of k: T, R and patches at c prime, U(H) and U(B) at n, main at m](redone-on-top.drawio.svg)

</div>

>   k=refs/splices/upstream/heads/patches~3 m=refs/splices/upstream/heads/patches~2 n=refs/splices/upstream/heads/patches~1
