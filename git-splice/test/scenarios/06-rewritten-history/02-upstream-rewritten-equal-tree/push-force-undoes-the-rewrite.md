# `push --force` undoes the rewrite

> **Known bug, [#38](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/38).** This page shows what `git-splice` does today, bug included. See [all known bugs](../../08-known-bugs.md).

In the [same state](README.md), after a local change made before a
`merge` or `pull` recorded the rewritten commit, `git splice push
--force` makes the monorepo's side win. Its rebuild starts from the old
synced commit, so the upstream gets back the history the rewrite removed.
Don't use it when the rewrite removed something, like a secret;
[keep the upstream's version](keep-the-upstream-version.md) instead.
