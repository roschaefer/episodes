# Scenario: upstream-rewritten-equal-tree

The upstream rewrote its history and force-pushed a new commit with
exactly the same files. The splice looks up to date, but its synced commit
is no longer part of the upstream's history. A `merge` or `pull` records
the new commit as the synced commit, so the next change builds on the
rewritten history
([#17](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/17)).

- **Monorepo (`vendor/a/`)**: *a* (`add vendor/a`) cloned *r*.
- **Upstream**: *k* (`seed`), *r* (`release`), then rewritten and
  force-pushed as one root commit, *w* (`release, history rewritten`), with
  *r*'s files. Already fetched.

That only works while the folder still has the upstream's files. After a
local change, the splice is `unrelated history`, and `merge` and `pull`
refuse to guess. Then [keep the upstream's
version](keep-the-upstream-version.md) and redo the local changes on top
of it. If the rewrite removed something, like a secret, don't use the
other ways out that `merge` prints
([#38](https://github.com/roschaefer/git-splice/issues/38)).
`git splice push --force` rebuilds on top of the old synced commit, and
so [publishes the rewritten-away history
again](push-force-undoes-the-rewrite.md). Keeping both publishes the
monorepo's own history of the folder, which contains whatever the
monorepo pulled before the rewrite.

<div align="center">

![The monorepo's a records r, the old release on top of k; T is w, the rewritten release, a root commit of its own](upstream-rewritten-equal-tree.drawio.svg)

</div>

U(H) is *r*, but T is *w*, which shares no history with it. No upstream
branch has *k* and *r* any more, so they're dashed.

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

The splice is up to date: the folder has the upstream's files.

```scrut
$ git splice status
On branch main

  up to date  vendor/a
```

But `.splice` names the old `release`, which the upstream's history no
longer contains. The upstream's `main`, as fetched, is the ref ending in
`/main`:

```scrut
$ main="$(
>   git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:lstrip=4) %(objectname)' refs/splices/ |
>     sed -n 's#^main ##p'
> )"
```

```scrut
$ synced="$(git config --file vendor/a/.splice splice.commit)" &&
>   git merge-base --is-ancestor "$synced" "$main" || echo "not in the upstream's history"
not in the upstream's history
```

A `merge` records the rewritten commit as the synced commit, in a commit
that changes only `.splice`:

```scrut
$ git splice merge vendor/a
ok   vendor/a: recorded bc05937 as the synced commit -- the folder already has its files
```

```scrut
$ git show --stat --format=%s HEAD
splice: merge vendor/a from main at bc05937

 vendor/a/.splice | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

A local change now builds on the rewritten history:

```scrut
$ echo "local change" >>vendor/a/file.txt && git commit -q -a -m "local change"
```

```scrut
$ git splice push vendor/a
ok   vendor/a: pushed 5c7d4e1 to main
```

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM" log --format=%s main
local change
release, history rewritten
```
