# Keep the upstream's version

The safe way out of the [same state](README.md) after a local change,
made before a `merge` or `pull` recorded the rewritten commit:
splice the rewritten upstream in again, and redo the local change on top
of it. The upstream's history stays as rewritten, which matters if the
rewrite removed something, like a secret.

## Output

<!--
```scrut {fail_fast: true, output_stream: combined}
$ source "$TESTDIR/../../readme-setup.sh"
```
-->

[`setup.bash`](setup.bash) builds this state:

```scrut
$ build_scenario scenario_upstream_rewritten_equal_tree
```

```scrut
$ echo "local change" >>vendor/a/file.txt &&
>   git commit -q -a -m "local change" &&
>   git splice status
On branch main

  !! unrelated history  vendor/a  see 'git splice merge vendor/a' for options
```

Save the local change as a patch, with paths inside the folder:

```scrut
$ git diff --relative=vendor/a HEAD~1 -- vendor/a >../local-change.patch
```

Remove the folder, and splice the rewritten upstream in again:

```scrut
$ git rm -r -q -- vendor/a &&
>   git commit -q -m "remove vendor/a" &&
>   git splice clone -- "$UPSTREAM" vendor/a
===  vendor/a: fetching $UPSTREAM
ok   vendor/a: cloned 5cc12da from main
```

Redo the local change, and push it:

```scrut
$ git apply --directory=vendor/a ../local-change.patch &&
>   git commit -q -a -m "local change" &&
>   git splice push vendor/a
ok   vendor/a: pushed 2a8eb25 to main
```

The upstream's history is still the rewritten one:

```scrut
$ git -C "$UPSTREAM" log --format=%s main
local change
w: release, history rewritten
```
